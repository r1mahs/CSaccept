A script that automatically accepts a Q pop in league of legends 

This is my first of many (hopefully) projects to come.

It uses pyautogui to search your screen for a the queue pop on league of legends and then moves your cursor to it.

For it to work, its important that you have 'queuepop.png' in the same directory as the script otherwise it wont be able to read the photo.

Otherwise its pretty simple, just turn on the script and go AFK.

Thanks, and any feedback would be appreciated.
